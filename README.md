# Bank Churn Prediction

The regional bank in Europe wants to predict the probability that a customer will churn in order to:

* Have a better understanding of its customers and factors impacting their retention

* Evaluate opportunities for marketing and product improvements

* Ultimately enhance customer retention and engagement

Specifically, in this analysis, I compared demographic and account information across customers who have churned and who have not churned and use these information to predict whether or not a new customer will churn. Keeping track of this bank's customer retention can help the bank to improve their products and enhance customer engagement.



This project consists of several parts:

* Exploratory Data Analysis

* Predictive Modeling

* Evaluate Model Performance

* Web Application
